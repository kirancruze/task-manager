I created a Task Manager web app to help users keep track of their daily tasks. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks easily. One of the best features is that it saves tasks automatically using local storage, so even if the page is refreshed, the tasks remain.

Why I Built This:
I wanted to apply my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills in a practical project. This app helped me understand how to handle user interactions, manage data efficiently, and improve UI design.

What It Does:
✅ Users can add tasks by entering text
✅ Clicking on a task marks it as completed
✅ A delete button allows users to remove tasks
✅ The app remembers tasks even after refreshing the page

Technologies Used:
HTML – To structure the web page

CSS – To style the layout and improve UI

JavaScript – To handle user actions and store tasks
